    I’ve previously been a <strong>Front-end Engineer</strong> at <a href="https://upside.com.au/">Upside</a>, <strong>Lead Front-end Developer</strong> at <a href="https://www.okendo.io/">Okendo</a>, <strong>Front-end Developer, Team Lead</strong> at <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/">Freelancer.com</a> and <strong>Front-end Developer</strong> at <a href="http://infasecure.com.au/">InfaSecure</a>.

    You can find some of my stuff on <a href="https://codepen.io/qkevinto/">CodePen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/qkevinto/">GitHub</a>, including the source for <a href="https://github.com/qkevinto/kevinto.me">this site</a>!

    I make things with CSS, HTML, JavaScript and background in design — I studied and worked as a Designer for about 6 years and now enjoy building accessible, lean and maintainable Front-end stacks, and have been doing it for the past ${experienceYears} years or so.

  <p>
    When I’m not making stuff for the web, I enjoy building and flying drones, tinkering with electronics projects, four-wheel driving, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/qkevinto/">photography</a>, exploring the outdoors and travelling!
