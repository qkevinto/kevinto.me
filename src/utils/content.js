    I make things with CSS, HTML, JavaScript and background in design â€” I studied and worked as a Designer for about 6 years and now enjoy building accessible, lean and maintainable Front-end stacks, and have been doing it for the past 4 years or so.

    When Iâ€™m not making things for the web, I enjoy <a href="https://getpocket.com/@kevinto">reading</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/qkevinto/">photography</a>, travelling and the great outdoors. I go out exploring, catch the sunrise and take photos almost every weekend! ðŸ“·
