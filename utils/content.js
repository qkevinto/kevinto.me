    I make things with CSS, HTML, JavaScript and an eye for design — I studied and worked as a Designer for about 6 years but now enjoy building accessible, lean and maintainable Front-end stacks, and have been doing it for the past 3 years or so.

    When I’m not making websites, I enjoy <a href="https://getpocket.com/@kevinto">reading</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/qkevinto/">photography</a>, travelling and the great outdoors.
