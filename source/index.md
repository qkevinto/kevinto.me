[infasecure.com.au](http://infasecure.com.au/), [spacebarkid.com](http://spacebarkid.com/), and [shannateng.com](http://shannateng.com/) are some things I’ve made, and Okendo in Sydney, Australia is where I currently work. In the past, I've also worked at Freelancer.com and InfaSecure.

You can find more of my stuff on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/qkevinto/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/qkevinto/), including the source for [this site](https://github.com/qkevinto/kevinto.me)!

I make things with CSS, HTML, JavaScript and an eye for design &mdash; I studied and worked as a Designer for about 6 years but now enjoy building accessible, lean and maintainable Front-end stacks, and have been doing it for the past 3 years or so.

When I’m not making websites, I enjoy [reading](https://getpocket.com/@kevinto), [photography](https://www.instagram.com/qkevinto/), travelling and the great outdoors.

Feel free to say g’day at [hello@kevinto.me](mailto:hello@kevinto.me), follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/qkevinto) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://au.linkedin.com/in/qkevinto).
