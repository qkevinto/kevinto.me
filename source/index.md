[infasecure.com.au](http://infasecure.com.au/), [spacebarkid.com](http://spacebarkid.com/) and [shannateng.com](http://shannateng.com/) are some things I’ve made, and Freelancer.com in Sydney, Australia is where I work.</p>

You can find more of my stuff on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/qkevinto/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/qkevinto/)!

I make things with CSS, HTML, JavaScript and an eye for design &mdash; I studied and worked as a Designer for about 6 years but now enjoy writing clean and maintainable code and have been doing so for over 3 years.

When I’m not crafting websites, I enjoy [photography](https://500px.com/kevinto), traveling and the great outdoors.

Feel free to say g’day at [hello@kevinto.me](mailto://hello@kevinto.me) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://au.linkedin.com/in/qkevinto).
